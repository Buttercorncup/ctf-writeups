## Challenge Solution
For this challenge, I first looked up nerhadeaguilar on this [website](https://www.idcrawl.com/username) and found a twitter profile. From the twitter profile, we can see some information like the tweets as well as the profile bio "I get rid of people". From there we know that we are heading in the right direction.

Seeing that the profile has 1 follower and following, I wanted to find out who that might be. Turns out that we found another interesting account xslkohkop that has the profile bio "Thanks for getting rid of Afiq".

Since we found the account from nerhadeaguilar's following, I decided to look through xslkohkop's following and followers. After looking for awhile, I was not able to find anything. At this point I thought maybe I could try searching the username up on instagram instead. Interestingly enough, I was able to find a profile with the username xslkohkop and the profile bio "i hate Afiq".

I looked through the posts made on the account but was not able to find any interesting information. I then tried to look through the account's followers as well as following and found what seemed to be Afiq's instagram account.

From there, all you have to do is visit Afiq's account to retrieve the flag.
